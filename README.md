Thank you for visiting my profile. 
I’m data analyst with diverse range of experience. I’m always eager to learn and I’m easily trainable. 
My experience includes PL/SQL and T-SQL development, ETL workflows using KNIME and Power Query, SAP data extraction, KPI reporting, and financial analytics.
I’m currently preparing for the Microsoft PL-300 certification and further developing my skills in BI and data engineering.
